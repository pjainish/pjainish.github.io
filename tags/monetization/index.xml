      <description>&lt;p&gt;The moment you ask ChatGPT about a travel destination and it casually mentions a specific hotel booking platform, or when Claude suggests a particular coding tool while helping with your programming question, you&amp;rsquo;re witnessing something fascinating: the intersection of artificial intelligence and advertising. What seems like helpful, neutral advice might actually be the result of careful economic engineering beneath the hood of these language models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about banner ads cluttering up your chat interface - that would be crude and obvious. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about something far more sophisticated: weaving promotional content seamlessly into the fabric of AI-generated text itself. It&amp;rsquo;s a practice that&amp;rsquo;s quietly reshaping how we think about AI neutrality, user trust, and the economics of running these incredibly expensive models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
